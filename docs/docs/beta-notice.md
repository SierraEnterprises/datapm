title: DataPM Beta Notice
---

DataPM is software that is in beta preview. You are welcome to use it within the constraints of the [license](license.md) - but you should be very careful about using it in production.

# Is DataPM safe for production use?

DataPM software, including the registry and the client, is in an open beta preview. This means that it is not yet ready for production use. If you decide to use DataPM software in production, we recommend doing so only behind a private firewall - and not on the open public internet.

# When will DataPM be ready for production?

Join our mailing list and Slack channel to be notified when DataPM is ready for production use.

# What can I do with DataPM now?

DataPM is a great resource for public data sharing, and previewing capabilities for future production purposes. You can use the [DataPM client](command-line-client.md) to load public data into your data systems. And you can [host your own private registry](private-registry.md) in a private network to create your own internal data catalog.
