This page describes DataPM, how it works, why you need it, and the license granted to you.

## What is DataPM?

DataPM stands for Data Package Manager, and it helps publishers and consumers of data more easily transact. Think of DataPM like homebrew, apt, or yum - but for data.

DataPM helps you quickly search, review, and obtain data packages. And DataPM delivers that data to the target repository and in the format that you request.

DataPM works with batch data deliveries, and in the near future will work with streaming data. And DataPM supports public and private data exchange. 


## Who uses DataPM?

Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Researchers, Analysts, and any other data-oriented knowledge workers use DataPM to collaborate and make working registries of data. Search the public registry, or read stories about how others are using DataPM. 

## How do people interact with DataPM?

Data publishers, such as researchers or analyst, use simple DataPM tools that automatically read existing data sets, and produce a Data Package File. The publisher then enhances this package file with simple documentation and other supporting materials. Finally, with a single command, the package file is published to a public or private DataPM registry. 

Data consumers, such as Data Scientists or Financial Managers, use the public or private DataPM registries to obtain data packages. These conusmers can search for topcis of interest, subscribe to publishers or package files, and of course fetch or stream those data packages as needed. 

Data Engineers can use DataPM tools to dramatically simplify and automate the publishing and consuming of data packages. DataOps (like DevOps) can greatly improve the quality of a publishing and consuming process! 


## What does DataPM cost?

DataPM is an ecosystem of free and (soon to be) open source tools that are used to publish and consume free and non-free data packages. Data publishers define the pricing for their own data packages.

DataPM also plans to offer free and paid tools that help publishers and consumers better understand the contents of their data packages. We will make announcements about these additional free and paid tools in the future.
