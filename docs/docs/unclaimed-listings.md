## What are unclaimed listings in DataPM?

An unclaimed listing is a listing that has no explicit owner, and where no copyrights are asserted. The listing was created by someone who found the data to be useful, but that user did not claim copyright ownership.

## How do I claim an unclaimed listing?

Be sure to [Sign Up](/signup), for an account. Then use the [Contact Form](/contact) to contact the administrator of the registry. Provide evidence of your claim, and your email address. The administrator, once approved, can assign the listing to your DataPM account.

## Where is the data stored?

For unclaimed listings, the data is not hosted in the DataPM registry. Instead it is simply referenced by the registry. The unclaimed listing contains only a description of the data, sample records, and how to access the data.

## The advantages of publishing with DataPM

Publishing your data in DataPM gives you multiple advantages.

1. Your data will be cataloged under your name.
2. Your data will be protected by DataPM's advanced security and permission systems.
3. Your data will be easily consumable using the DataPM tools.

## What if I don't want my data listed on DataPM?

Use the [Contact Form](/contact) to request that your data be removed. Please provide the URL of the exact listing(s) you want removed, and proof of IP ownership.
