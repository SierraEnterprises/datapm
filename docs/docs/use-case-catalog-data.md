DataPM helps you organize your data into catalogs and collections.

## Catalogs

In DataPM, a catalog represents a person or team's published set of data packages. Every data package belongs to one and only one catalog.

Think of a catalog as designating an owner for the data, just like a book publisher would have a catalog of their books.

## Collections

In DataPM, a collection is an index of data packages that share a theme. Data packages may be in zero or more collections.

Think of a collection like a indexing system by topic. You can create your own collections of packages across the registry. And you can view and follow the collections that other people have created.
